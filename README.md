# Global-regional-and-contextual-features-for-AIA-image-retrieval-system
Implemented script is about Image annotation and retrieval system by combination of global and regional features by using different methods 

Implemented system use three kinds of features include global, regional and contextual information which are helpful to describe image semantics to annotate images by estimating their joint probability.
